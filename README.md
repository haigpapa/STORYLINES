# Storylines

**AI-Powered Literary Exploration Platform**

Storylines is a production-grade web application that transforms the way you explore literature through interactive graph visualization, semantic search, and AI-powered contextual enrichment. Discover hidden connections between books, authors, genres, themes, and literary movements in an immersive, visually stunning constellation interface.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Interactive Graph Visualization**: Force-directed graph canvas powered by D3.js with smooth canvas rendering
- **Semantic Search**: Unified search across OpenLibrary and Google Books APIs
- **Progressive Discovery**: Click nodes to view details, double-click to expand and discover related content
- **AI Contextual Enrichment**: Google Gemini API integration for intelligent insights and hidden connections
- **Visual Language System**: Distinct colors and icons for each node type (authors, books, genres, themes, characters, movements)

### User Experience

- **Reading Lists**: Save books to your personal reading list with status tracking
- **Bookmarks**: Mark interesting nodes for later exploration
- **Session Persistence**: Resume your exploration exactly where you left off
- **Export/Import**: Save and share your literary constellation maps
- **Dev Journal**: Built-in workflow logging showing your exploration process

### Technical Highlights

- **React + TypeScript**: Modern, type-safe component architecture
- **D3.js Force Simulation**: Physics-based graph layout with customizable forces
- **IndexedDB Caching**: Client-side storage for offline access and performance
- **Zustand State Management**: Efficient, minimal global state
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive, accessible design system
- **API Rate Limiting**: Smart request queuing and caching

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- (Optional) Google Gemini API key for AI insights

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/storylines.git
cd storylines

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will open at `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Usage Guide

### 1. Search & Seed

Start by searching for a book, author, or theme using the search panel. Click any result to add it as a node to your graph.

### 2. Expand & Explore

- **Click** a node to view detailed information in the info panel
- **Double-click** a node to expand and discover related content
- **Drag** nodes to rearrange the graph layout

### 3. AI Insights (Optional)

Enable AI insights by providing a Google Gemini API key. Get your free key at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

### 4. Manage Your Collection

- Add books to your reading list
- Bookmark interesting discoveries
- Export your graph for sharing or backup

## Architecture

### Frontend Stack

```
React 19 + TypeScript
├── D3.js v7 - Force-directed graph visualization
├── Tailwind CSS - Styling and responsive design
├── Zustand - State management
└── Lucide React - Icon system
```

### API Integrations

- **OpenLibrary API**: Book and author metadata
- **Google Books API**: Enhanced book information and covers
- **Google Gemini API**: AI-powered contextual insights

### Data Storage

```
IndexedDB (via idb)
├── nodes - Graph nodes with metadata
├── edges - Relationships between nodes
├── sessions - User session snapshots
└── cache - API response caching
```

- Canvas-based rendering for smooth 60fps
- Lazy loading of AI enrichment
- IndexedDB for persistent caching
- Debounced search queries

## Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast mode
- Screen reader friendly
- Focus management
- ARIA labels

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Type Checking
